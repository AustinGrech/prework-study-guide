# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>


## Description


this is a prework study guide website created for boot camp students going through the Prework.


Building this website solved the issue of needing to go back into my notes to remind myself about information on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript in which I otherwise could not remember at the time.
